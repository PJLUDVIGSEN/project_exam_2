## Functional Specification
- **Landing Page**: A fullscreen video or slideshow with login and registration forms.
- **User Authentication**: Users can log in or register. Credentials are stored in `localStorage`.
- **Browse Page**: Users can view a list of games, filter by genres, and add games to their cart.
- **Details Page**: Detailed information about a specific game, including the option to add it to the cart.
- **Cart Page**: Displays selected games and allows users to proceed to checkout.
- **Checkout Page**: A form for user details and payment information, with a confirmation modal.
- **Common Elements**: Includes a logout button and breadcrumb navigation for ease of use.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the project directory
cd project_exam_2
3. Install NPM packages
npm install


### Running the Project
To run the project locally:

### `npm start`

## Deployment
For deployment, use:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
